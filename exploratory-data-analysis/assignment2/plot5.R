# Question: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
#
# Strategy: 
# 0. Prior analysis has showed that the data does not contain NAs, and are already loaded with the correct classes
# 1. Select the SCC codes of the vehicle related sources; the codes selected were the ones in which the word "Vehicle" appears at the short name
# 2. Create a data frame with the consolidated sum of all emission per year, with filtering to the vehicle related SCC Codes and the Baltimore fips
# 3. Plot the graph to see what were the changes from 1999 to 2008
# 
# Conclusion: It had a substancial decrease in the year 2002
