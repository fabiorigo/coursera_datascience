# Question: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
#
# Strategy: 
# 0. Prior analysis has showed that the data does not contain NAs, and are already loaded with the correct classes
# 1. Select the SCC codes of the coal combustion-related sources; the codes selected were the ones in which the word "Coal" appears at the short name
# 2. Create a data frame with the consolidated sum of all emission per year, with filtering to the coal related SCC Codes
# 3. Plot the graph to see what were the changes from 1999 to 2008
# 
# Conclusion: It had a substancial decrease in the year 2008
